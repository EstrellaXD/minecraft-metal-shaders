// M3.3 (dims): the aurora at reduced resolution (mcopt.metal.shade.dims.ShadeAurora, mcopt.shade.aurora.half). One
// full-screen pass into an RGBA16F texture a fraction of the output size, before the world pass: each texel takes
// shadeAurora (shade_dims.metal, M3.2's function unchanged) for its direction in this frame's jittered view, the same
// rays the sky pass derives its directions from (sky.vs.metal: shadeViewRay of uv * 2 - 1). The sky pass then reads it with
// one bilinear tap at the pixel's screen position (shadeAuroraTex). Pre-exposure radiance, like the sky it is added to.
// Source order: ShadeRender.prelude() + shade_post.metal (shade_fs_vs) + this file.
